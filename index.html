                My name is Trevor and here's a little bit more about who I am: I was born here in the Mile High City. I
                have a dog named Byron. Ideally I would love to be able to become successful at front-end web
                development
                because I am colorblind and that would provide a creative outlet. Or maybe it will prove to be
                DISASTROUS!!!
            </p>

                I have a little brother named Nathan. He went to school to be an archaeologist. He loves history. I too
                enjoy history and even pursued it as a major in college along with Political Science.

                The coolest place I've ever been is Norway. It was so beautiful. The people there have such a respect
                for
                nature. Some people even go as far as to grow a native grass on their roof.

                That's all.
